# 03b - Mini-ISM Manual

## 1. Introduction

All yachts engaged in trade under 500 gross tonnage must maintain a mini-ISM system on board. Privately used yachts (<500GT) may also choose to use the system voluntarily to provide standard safety management good practices. This is a simplified version of the ISM system which documents and records the yacht's safety management and benefits everyone on board.

Yachting Concept Monaco has developed simple guidelines for creating a safe working environment that includes:

- Health and Safety Protection Policy
- Procedures to Ensure Safe Operation of Vessels
- Maintenance of the Vessel and Equipment
- Procedures for Reporting Accidents
- Procedures for responding to emergency situations
- Crew training
- Preparation for Emergencies and reporting of Accidents
- Lines of communication between personnel, ashore and onboard
- The captain must be able to demonstrate compliance during survey

The mini-ISM implements a simple but effective safety management system for vessels under 500GT. The reduced number of officers onboard can still maintain an efficient level of safety.

The company works closely with the crew to implement a yacht-specific system and trains officers onboard for smooth operation of the procedures but will not be responsible in case of an accident.

## 2. Overview

Effective and efficient management requires commitment from the top. In matters of safety, health, environmental protection and workplace practices, the commitment, skills, motivation and attitudes of individuals at all levels determine the end result.

Yachting Concept Monaco recognises the overriding authority of the Master and his responsibility to make decisions regarding safety and pollution prevention, and will provide resources to assist the Master in carrying out his duties.

## 3. Safety policy

The safe operation of managed yachts and all crew members' safety, health and security are most important to Yachting Concept Monaco. The company will encourage dialogue and feedback from all those involved in and affected by the Safety Management System to achieve continuous improvement.

Yachting Concept Monaco's objectives drive this safety policy to reduce the risks of accidents, incidents and cases of work-related ill health. The company ensures that everyone involved in the management and operation of yachts within the fleet receives adequate training to ensure competence. The intention is to prevent incidents and accidents from occurring but, where this is not possible, our system enables all parties to respond efficiently during emergencies and to return to safe working practices as soon as possible.

## 4. Environmental protection policy

Yachting Concept Monaco recognises the negative impact that pollution from ships has had on the marine environment. We will encourage all Masters and Crew to adopt a responsible attitude to the environment, comply with appropriate MARPOL and all other applicable laws and regulations and take the utmost care to prevent pollution.

In the event of a pollution incident involving any of its managed yachts, Yachting Concept Monaco will offer all appropriate assistance at its disposal to the yacht and the Flag and Port States to minimise the effects of the pollution and will assist as requested with clean-up efforts. Waste products will be disposed of using only approved procedures and waste treatment facilities. Environmental protection is the responsibility of every individual involved in the management and operation of yachts and is to be practised in every operational task.

Yachting Concept Monaco is committed to managing yachts to the highest Health, Safety, and Environmental standards. It will strive to meet all the duties and obligations imposed on Yacht Managers from Flag State and other international legislation.

## 5. Drugs and alcohol

Yachting Concept Monaco recognises that all those employed on yachts have a safety and security-related role. Excessive use, misuse, or abuse of drugs or alcohol by any crew member endangers the safety and security of the yacht. While on duty, the crew shall not be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Excessive use, misuse or abuse of drugs or alcohol will be considered a disciplinary offence which may lead to immediate dismissal.

The use, possession or distribution of illegal drugs and substances is a crime. We will assist any appropriate drug law enforcement agency to fulfil its functions. Unannounced drug testing of the crew may be carried out on a random basis by a third party appointed by Yachting Concept Monaco.

## 6. Fatigue

Yachting Concept Monaco recognises the dangers when tired personnel are involved in the operation of yachts. It will assist Owners and Masters to ensure the yacht is adequately crewed with sufficiently trained and appropriately qualified crew, such that all legislation, guidance and advice relating to hours of work and rest periods are followed.

Yachting Concept Monaco expects all onboard personnel to follow the requirements of Hours of Work and Rest regulations as per international MLC regulations. On-board personnel are required to complete each month, the day-by-day record of hours of rest to be verified by the Master, to allow monitoring of compliance with the minimum requirements.

## 7. Harassment and bullying

Harassment or bullying can be defined as acts of intimidation, coercion, and interference with the work of other seafarers, and conduct based on gender affecting the dignity of women and men at work, which is unwanted, unreasonable and/or offensive to the recipient. Yachting Concept Monaco will not tolerate such acts.

Cyberbullying is the use of modern communication technologies to harass, embarrass, humiliate, threaten, or intimidate an individual in an attempt to gain power and control over them. The use of the yacht's or company's communication systems for such purposes will be treated as a serious breach of the company code of conduct and result in disciplinary action against the perpetrators.

Yachting Concept Monaco will treat all complaints of harassment and bullying seriously and in strict confidence. You may approach either the Senior Officer on board or a manager ashore to report any incident you have suffered.

If you do not feel comfortable raising a complaint yourself, you may ask a friend or colleague to do so on your behalf. You will not be penalised by the company for making a complaint, provided it is not vexatious or made maliciously.

## 8. Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct for the Merchant Navy defines acceptable and unacceptable conduct and provides the framework for disciplinary action. A copy is available on board.

## 9. Implementation

Yachting Concept Monaco will help the crew to ensure that all policies are implemented and maintained throughout all levels of the yacht by providing a full set of templates available from the full ISM library, adapted to the size of the yacht.

By engaging in a schedule of audits and checks to verify that the policies are displayed in relevant locations, are understood by crew and relevant procedures are being followed, Yachting Concept Monaco verifies the correct implementation of safety procedures onboard.

## 10. Training

All personnel shall receive training appropriate to the tasks they undertake. It is the responsibility of the Master to ensure that this training is given, and that crew members have an understanding of the relevant regulations and rules.

As a minimum, this means:

- for the master, the relevant qualifications;
- for the crew, relevant qualifications and any additional training appropriate to their designated duties.

At the first occasion after embarking on the vessel, each crew member shall receive appropriate familiarisation training and proper instruction in onboard procedures. This could include, but not necessarily be limited to:

- mooring and unmooring;
- launching and recovery of survival craft;
- evacuation from all areas of the vessel;
- donning of lifejackets; and
- use and handling of firefighting equipment.

## 11. Onboard Procedures

Simple procedures shall be developed for the operation of the vessel using the templates provided by the company. These shall include, but not be limited to:

- testing of equipment, including steering gear, prior to commencing a passage;
- navigation and handling of the vessel;
- maintenance routines;
- bunkering operations;
- watertight/weathertight integrity;
- emergency towing;
- safe use and qualification of users for personal watercraft.

## 12. Preparation for Emergencies

The potential emergencies likely to be encountered by the vessel shall be considered. Drills shall then be carried out regularly in the handling of these emergencies and evacuation from the vessel.

These drills shall include, but not be limited to:

- Firefighting and abandoning ship;
- Recovery from enclosed spaces;
- Loss of power and steering;
- Grounding, flooding, collision;
- Man overboard
- Medical emergencies

All personnel shall be involved in these exercises. The roles and responsibilities of all personnel in an emergency shall be defined in a "Muster list" document that should be published in the crew area and every crew member is expected to learn and understand his or her role.

The exercises and names of those who participated shall be recorded. It is also recommended to maintain regular safety meetings where senior officers should create an onboard safety culture.

## 13. Reporting of Accidents

Vessels operating under mini-ISM shall report any accidents to the company and shall therefore have a procedure in place. Additionally, all accidents and near accidents shall be recorded and reported to the Company/Owner, who shall implement corrective action to improve safety.

## 14. Maintenance of the Vessel and Equipment

Maintenance of the vessel and equipment is essential to safety management. The equipment shall be checked and tested daily when in use.

A maintenance plan should be in place using Deepblue© software. The plan shall include both inspections and preventive maintenance programmes of the vessel and equipment. Special attention must be paid to critical equipment where sudden failure can lead to an immediate accident.

The frequency of the inspections and maintenance should follow the equipment maintenance manual or can be determined by the Master, Company, or Owner, but every event shall be recorded. Safety equipment, LSA, firefighting devices, fire protection treatment and fixed firefighting equipment should be included in the maintenance and inspection plan but shall follow international regulations such as SOLAS.

## 15. Review

For yachts under mandatory mini-ISM requirements, Yachting Concept Monaco will conduct a review of the onboard safety management system with the Master or Owner at least once every three years. This review aims to improve and streamline the system while identifying potential safety vulnerabilities. For other yachts using mini-ISM voluntarily, Yachting Concept Monaco may assist the owning company and master, if requested, to improve the efficiency of the system during regular onboard review.
